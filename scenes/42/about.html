		<h1>Our History:</h1>
		<h3>At least 1 and a half years ago, this island was split from the main continent due to being too ugly</h3>
		<h3>To feel better about themselves, the original inhabitants, called the "Sielgu", decided to dig the massive canal on the northwest side of the island</h3>
		<h3>They didn't know that there was already a passage for boats, so they waited for people to come visit, but nobody came</h3>
		<h1>Company Founding:</h1>
		<h3>Eventually, our founder's boat took a wrong turn and went through the passage.</h3>
		<h3>After exploring for a bit he found that the island was so ugly, a new element was formed under it, which he named "uglyium"</h3>
		<img src="uglium.png" style="width:150px;" alt="uglyium">
		<h3>This element emits so much radioactivity that it's (probably) safe. We do think this is what made this place and it's native population so ugly</h3>
		<h3>After doing some research we found this is a great power source with combined with Hydrogen (UgH<sub>2</sub>) refered to as Hug, Ugh, or Uglyane, so we "liberated" the natives to the tiny island they dug through treaties so it's fair :)</h3>
		<h1>Today:</h1>
		<h3>Last year we depleated most of this island's Uglium</h3>
		<h3>To not waste valuable space, HQ decided to turn this into a tourism island</h3>
		<h5>(Don't tell them this, but I don't think they know what they are doing)</h5>
