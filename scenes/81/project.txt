7 Hours Left What can I implement:

Original Scene:
    Desert background - in assets as a png(Desert)
    Tomb in the middle - in assets as a png(tomb)
    explorer next to the Tomb - in assets as a png(explorer)
    sign to scene 10 to the Left - in assets as a png(sign)
    sign to scene 55 and 58 to the right - in assets as a png(sign)
    small stall next to the pyramid(stall.png)

explorer scene:
    you clikc on explorer, show explorer.png but bigger
    and desert.png as background
    talk to explorer
    options are leave or talk
    talk options will be made soon

Room Scene  
    depends on what you roll the room you get is chosen
    boom(explode)
    chest room
        coins, bombs, item, or artificat chance
    artifact room
    trap room
    npc room
        gambeling, shop
        each npc has its model (assets/gambelingnpc.png and so on)


Door Scene
    3 doors (use door.png from assets)
    background is pyramid background(pyramidbackground.pn)
    one middle, left, and right
    each are clickable but when you click on it a text bubble appears 
    shot text on what the room sounds like via the door
    confrim on going in or not

Market scene:
    you click on the stall, show market.png
    background is desert.png
    npc called marketnpc.png there 
    text interatction on whether you want to buy anything or leave

Intro:
Black screen and white text explaining what you see
Explorer comes up and text interaction starts
    add that saying reloading the screen loses data
    Explains the Tomb/the lore
    Maybe go through one loop of the tomb?(if im pressed for time skip it)
    Or make it so that the player can go up to explorer to go into the tomb(if they try clicking on it without going through explorer, explorer forces player to go in with them)
Once you go through first try of the tomb, player tries again and again(untill they get the 3 artifacts)

Outro:
Once you get the 3 artifacts, you auto go to explorer
Some text with how it works/thanks
some prize or smth

Game Loop:

First time:
Explorer explains how the tomb works when you go in together
every room has three doors
you have to proceed through each door and try to survive and collect artficats
you can use items as well
then gets Outro
Explains the shop as well - use coins you find, then buy stuff from the market

Regular:
You go in and try to get an artificat
go through doors and try to make it work!

REACH GOALS:
add more events
more npcs
etc.
