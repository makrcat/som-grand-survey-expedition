        <h1>D O U B L E T O W N</h1>
        <p>
            During the founding of Singletown, one of the explorers in the group, <strong> Dubius Dublius</strong>, was the first to notice an identical island to the west.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being the epic prankster that he was, Dubius knew that he had to take advantage of the situation. With convincing entusiam, he said:
        </p>
        <p class = "quote" style="margin-right: 50%;">
            "Everybody look! There's a giant mirror in the middle of the ocean! You can see the reflection of this island in it!""
        </p>
         <p>
            One guy questioned him:
        </p>
        <p class = "quote" style="margin-left: 50%;">
            "Why cant we see ourselves in it?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Dubius Dublius didnt need any skeptiks.
        </p>
        <img src="SCENE2.png">
        <p>
            He explained to the rest of the group why the mirror was so special.
        </p>
        <p class = "quote" style="margin-right: 50%;">
            "The mirror is so big that it can only reflect big things, like islands or buildings! Its also a little slow, so it;s delayed by like a day, because its so far away!"
        </p>
        <img src="SCENE3.png">
        <p>
            To keep the <i>"mirror"</i> up to date, he traveled to the other island that night and built a house to match the one built on Singletown.
        </p>
        <img src="SCENE4.png">
        <p>
            Ever since that night, he he's been going back every night to keep the prank going.
        </p>

        <p>
            He named the new island <strong> Doubletown</strong>, and nobody ever suspected a thing.
