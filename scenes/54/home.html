                This tomb contains the heroic soldiers who bravly defended our
                land from the Trianglish, during the War of the South. Many of
                these soldiers used heat to there advantage, but lots of them
                were wounded in battle, and they couldn't move, burning to death
                in the sun.

                collapsing caves. Now you can only get in through, by jumping in
                the deep underground lake.
